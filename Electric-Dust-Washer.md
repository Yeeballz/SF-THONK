The Electric Dust Washer is a Machine in the [Electric Machines](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) category. It obtains [Dusts](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) from [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) without any by-products.

## Obtaining

The Electric Dust Washer is crafted in the [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table). The recipes vary with the machine levels and can be found in the Slimefun guide. The Electric Dust Washer comes in following three tiers:

## Usage

The Electric Dust Washer has to be connected to an [Electrical Network](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) with sufficient energy to function.  
The slots of an Electric Dust Washer are as follows:  
![Electric Dust Washer Slots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki/master/images/electric-dust-washer-slots.png)
- The two cyan glass panes on the left are the input slots where [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) can be inserted.
- The orange slots on the right are the output slots where various [Dusts](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) are produced.

Once the output slots are filled, the Electric Dust Washer stops its operation until the output slots are cleared. Therefore, a [Cargo Management System](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management) is the most efficient way to handle an Electric Dust Washer and can be used to create complex automated dust collection systems.
