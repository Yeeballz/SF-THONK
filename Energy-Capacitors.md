![Different stages of an energy capacitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/item-capacitor.gif)

Energy Capacitors are [electric components](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which can store and transfer energy in an energy network.<br>
There are five "tiers" of capacitors, each with an increasing capacity.

## Obtaining
All six tiers of energy capacitors can be crafted in an [Enchanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
An energy capacitor must be placed within 7 blocks of a [machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#Machines), [generator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#Energy-generation), [energy regulator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator), or another capacitor (in a straight line; no diagonals).

They transfer energy between blocks in that range, so they can be used to extend your network.<br>
They will also store excess energy indefinitely, unless they are broken or the energy is used up.

A capacitor's side texture will change depending on how much energy is stored in it, but you can more accurately measure it with a [multimeter](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Multimeter).

## Capacity
Each tier of energy capacitor has a different capacity, listed below.

| Item | Capacity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Small Energy Capacitor | 128 J |
| Medium Energy Capacitor | 512 J |
| Big Energy Capacitor | 1024 J |
| Large Energy Capacitor | 8192 J |
| Carbonado Edged Energy Capacitor | 65536 J |
| Energized Energy Capacitor | 524288 J |
