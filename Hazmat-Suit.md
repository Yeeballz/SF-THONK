The Hazmat suit is part of the [Armor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Armor) category.<br>
It consists of four parts (listed below).<br><br>

| Piece  |  Bonus effects  |
| ------------- | -------------  |
| Scuba Helmet  |  Water breathing  |
| Hazmat Suit  |  Fire Resistance  |
| Hazmat Suit Leggings |  N/A  |
| Rubber Boots |  N/A  |

## Obtaining
Each piece can be crafted in the [Armor Forge](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Armor-Forge).

## Usage
When you wear the entire set it provides protection against [Radiation](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Radiation).<br>
The armor has poor durability, therefore it's best to only use it when necessary.
